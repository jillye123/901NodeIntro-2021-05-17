4. Reading the directions online in a browser is a good option if you have more than one monitor to use during class. In this case, you can keep the browser open in one monitor, while you code in the other.  

    If you are using a virtualized environment, you may wish to have your HOST machine with directions, and then the remote environment where you code.

1. Using only what we have covered so far, create a program which takes command line input and reverses it. 
    
    Create directory for your work called `reverse`. Create a module called `reverse.js` which takes in a string and returns a string with characters in the reverse order. Create a `program.js` in your folder and read in a string from the command line. Use the module you created and display the reversed version of the name.

1. Write a program that accepts a string as a parameter and converts the first letter of each word of the string in upper case.
Example string: 'the quick brown fox' 
Expected Output: 'The Quick Brown Fox '

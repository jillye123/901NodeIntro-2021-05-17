## Bonus #1

1. If done before others, create another type of event called 'break'.

1. When the 'break' event is omitted print out 'Check Emails'. You can put this in a named function handler, and add it to be called when the 'work' event is emitted too.

## Bonus #2

1. use setInterval and Math.random to create a number 1 to 20 - when it is 11 - raise an event called `sighting`. 

1. run the code and watch for the output

1. when exiting the program - use process - indicate how many times 11 was sighted.
